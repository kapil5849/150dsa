          Animal Shelter: An animal shelter, which holds only dogs and cats, operates on a strictly"first in, first out" basis. People must adopt either the "oldest" (based on arrival time) of all animals at the shelter, or they can select whether they would prefer a dog or a cat (and will receive the oldest animal of that type). They cannot select which specific animal they would like. Create the data structures to maintain this system and implement operations such as enqueue, dequeueAny, dequeueDog, and dequeueCat. You may use the built-in Linked list data structure.

        <Example code="The question asks us to design a system for an animal shelter that operates on a `first in, first out` basis. The shelter holds dogs and cats, and people can adopt either the oldest animal overall or choose a specific type (dog or cat) and receive the oldest animal of that type. We need to create data structures and implement operations such as enqueue (to add animals to the shelter), dequeueAny (to adopt the oldest animal), dequeueDog (to adopt the oldest dog), and dequeueCat (to adopt the oldest cat). We can use the built-in linked list data structure to implement this system."/>
